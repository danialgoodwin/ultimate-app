# Features
- System-wide identity and profiles.


# Thoughts
- Apps don't need to say their name. Reason: It should be obvious based on context.
- Menus should appear 'on-hover'. Reason: The next most likely action will be opening the menu, and we can save that click.


# TODO
- Check Notepad++ for ideas on menu placement and splitting windows/tabs
    - Also, maybe check VS Code
- The selected tab should have the same color as the top border color of the focused window
